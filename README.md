# GitHub Report Generator

This script generates a report for a GitHub repository, including various statistics such as pull request count, commit count, lines added/deleted, and pull request change requests. The report is based on data retrieved from the GitHub API.

## Installation

Before using the script, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the GitHub CLI (gh) using the following command:

```powershell
snap install gh
```

After installing gh, authenticate with your GitHub account using the following command:

```powershell
gh auth login
```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```powershell
python3 gh_report.py REPO_OWNER REPO_NAME "DATE_RANGE"
```

## Where:

- REPO_OWNER is the owner or organization of the repository.
- REPO_NAME is the name of the repository.
- DATE_RANGE is the date range for which the report will be generated. This should be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD".

## Example

```powershell
python3 gh_report.py AGX-Software indiky-server "2024-05-01..2024-05-31"
```

## Output

The script generates a report similar to the following example:

```
